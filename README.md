## Overview
Two things that should always be strong: Coffee â˜• and Passwords ðŸ”‘.

In our digital age, where data breaches and hacks have skyrocketed, robust passwords are vital for safeguarding our online accounts. Using a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) or [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) is strongly recommended for storing and generating unique, strong passwords. However, preferences vary, and even if you're using a password manager, it's crucial to ensure that your passwords haven't been compromised in data breaches.
 
This app seamlessly integrates with [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com) to check if your password has been compromised in any known breaches, without actually sending your password to it.
